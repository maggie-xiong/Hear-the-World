# Hear the World
A wearable headpiece that better helps the visually impaired people detect their surroundings by using sound location.

The headpiece will use sound waves to locate and detect where objects are. Not only will the visually impaired people be able to detect the distance of an object but they will also be able to determine the size of the object by the movement of their head. From the invention of the headpiece, we are hoping that visually impaired people can advance even more in their ability to "see" their surroundings by forming mental images in their minds of their environment, and be able to move more independently than before, without worrying about being harmed by unseen surroundings. We are hoping our headpiece headpiece can have an effect to our visually impaired family and friends, our community, and maybe even have our idea expanded to a more global picture.

# Methods

• Plug the cable connected to the adafruit trinket onto a laptop and upload the python code/n

• Soldered pieces of thick wire (provided with the adafruit) onto the mounting holes- ‘GND’, ‘5V’,  ‘#0’, ‘#1’, ‘#2’, ‘#4’, ‘USB’,’ BAT’, ‘RST’ on the adafruit./n

• Ribbon wires are cut in half and inserted onto the soldered wires on ‘GND’ and ‘BAT’ on the adafruit/n

• The ultrasonic sensor’s, ‘VCC,’ ‘TRIG’, ‘ECHO’ are inserted to ribbons wires then to the adafruit: ‘VCC’- ( wire) - 5V   :  ‘TRIG’- ( wire) - #2  : ‘ ECHO’- (wire) - #0 ; the ribbon wires are inserted into the soldered wires on the adafruit/n

• One side of the 100K resistor is soldered to the positive lead (longer lead) of the buzzer and the other side is connected to a ribbon wire that connects to the soldered wire on ‘#4’ on the adafruit/n

• One side of the 100k resistor is soldered to the positive lead (longer lead) of the second buzzer and the other side is connected to a ribbon wire (cut on the other end) which is soldered onto the ‘#4’on the adafruit/n

• The buzzer’s negative lead is connected to a ribbon wire which is connected to a hook up wire that is soldered to ‘GND’ on the adafruit. The second buzzer’s negative lead is connected to a ribbon wire which is connected to a hook up wire that is soldered to ‘GND’ on the adafruit/n

• The ultrasonic sensor’s ‘GND’ is connected to a ribbon wire which is connected to a hook up wire that is soldered to ‘GND’ on the adafruit. In result, the ground of the buzzers, the ground of the ultrasonic sensor, and the negative wire of the battery case’s will all be connected to the ground on the adafruit trinket through one ribbon wire.
